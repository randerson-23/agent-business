# Roadmap — from "60056 Weekly" to a multi-ZIP trip/weekend planner

This is the continuity doc for autonomous, chunked iteration (this repo is
being built by an agent on a fast recurring loop — read this file first on
each pickup to see current phase and what's next, and update it as phases
complete).

## Vision

Start with one hyperlocal digest (Mount Prospect, IL / 60056) and grow it
into a small network of ZIP-code pages that can be strung together —
useful both for locals planning a weekend and for visitors planning a trip
across a few nearby towns. Same monetization model (local sponsor slot per
region) scales with it.

Design goals for the site itself (from the 2026-08-26 direction, refined
same day after seeing the first pass):
- Fast-loading, good-looking, easy to navigate — and modern enough that a
  local business owner takes the sponsor pitch seriously (see Phase 7; the
  first pass reads too much like a classifieds board for that).
- Filterable at a glance: kid-friendly, dog-friendly, free, indoor/outdoor,
  etc.
- Enough info in the card itself (date, time, tags, one-line description)
  that a reader mostly doesn't need to click through to know if an event
  is for them.
- Distance from the viewer, so "what's nearby" is answerable at a glance
  too (see Phase 8).

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Single-ZIP MVP ✅ done
Fetchers (RSS/ICS/HTML), digest builder, GitHub Pages, sponsor kit,
outreach templates, tests. Live for 60056.

### Phase 1 — Infra hardening ✅ done
Problem: hand-built commits that include the *generated* `docs/` output
kept colliding with the scheduled `build-digest.yml` workflow's own
auto-commits (hit this twice). Fix: generated site output is CI's job, not
a feature branch's — see "Working agreements" below. Still watch for this;
it's a practice, not something code enforces.

### Phase 2 — Multi-region data model ✅ done
`config/sources.yaml` → `config/regions/<region-id>.yaml`, one file per
ZIP/region, each with region metadata (id, name, city, state, zip,
timezone) plus its own `sources` and `evergreen` list. Build script
iterates every file in `config/regions/`.

### Phase 3 — Event tagging + at-a-glance info ✅ done
Heuristic keyword-based tagging (kid-friendly, dog-friendly, free,
indoor/outdoor, etc.) applied to fetched + evergreen items. Best-effort by
design — wrong or missing tags fail soft, same philosophy as the fetchers.
Curated sources (evergreen entries) can set tags explicitly in YAML.

### Phase 4 — Redesign: cards, badges, client-side filters ✅ done
Card-based layout per event: date/time, tag badges, one-line detail,
"View source" link. Vanilla-JS filter bar (no framework/build step, so it
stays fast) toggling tags client-side. Hub page lists all regions.

### Phase 5 — Second region (proves the architecture) ✅ done
Added Arlington Heights (60005) as a real second data point (village news,
library events, park district) — see PR #5. Also generalized
`fetch_html_events`'s "detail link" signal into a per-source
`detail_link_pattern` config override, instead of a hardcoded pattern.
**Not yet verified against a live build** — check the next scheduled
run's output for real Arlington Heights content, especially Village News
(should work first-try thanks to `detail_link_pattern`) and Library Events
(still on keyword-fallback, may need the same fix Mount Prospect's library
needed).

### Phase 6 — Per-region sponsor rotation (structure done, selling not started)
`config/sponsors.yaml` is already keyed by region (done alongside Phase 2).
What's left is actually selling into each region — see `SPONSOR_KIT.md` /
`OUTREACH_TEMPLATES.md`, which are per-business-owner outreach, outside
what this loop can automate.

### Phase 7 — Visual redesign: look modern enough to pitch sponsors (first slice ✅ done, PR #8)
Feedback (2026-08-26): the current card/badge design (Phase 4) reads flat
and dated — "more like a Craigslist site." Sponsors won't take a media kit
seriously if the site looks like a classifieds board, so this jumped ahead
of the other Phase 7 candidates.

Shipped in the first slice (PR #8):
- ✅ Typography: Fraunces (headings) + Inter (body) via Google Fonts.
- ✅ Elevation: real card shadows + hover lift, refined spacing/radius.
- ✅ Hero band (gradient + inline-SVG map-pin mark) on hub + region pages.
- ✅ Color: tag badges now use per-tag `hue` (see `tagging.TAG_DISPLAY`)
  instead of one flat green for every tag.
- ✅ Favicon (inline SVG data URI, same pin mark).
- ✅ Open Graph + Twitter Card *text* meta tags (title/description).
- ✅ Mobile pass verified with a Playwright screenshot at 390px.
- ✅ Bonus fix found along the way: ICS text wasn't RFC 5545-unescaped,
  so literal `\n`/`\,` were leaking into card text in production.

Still open from the original wish list (do later, not blocking):
- Open Graph **image** (needs an actual image asset — text-only OG tags
  shipped for now; ties to Phase 9 once there's a real domain/brand to
  design one around).
- A logo/wordmark beyond the generic pin mark — deliberately deferred
  since Phase 9's name/domain choice isn't made yet and a wordmark should
  match the eventual name, not be redone later.
- Consider a proper inline-SVG icon set instead of emoji tag badges, if
  emoji rendering ever looks off on a real device (untested outside this
  sandbox's Chromium render).

### Phase 8 — Distance from the user, per event (not started)
Requested 2026-08-26: show how far away each event/region is from the
person viewing the site.

Approach (v1, region-level — the honest starting point given the data we
actually have):
- Add lat/lon to each region's config (village-center coordinates are easy
  to source and good enough for a first version; individual events don't
  have structured addresses from the fetchers today, so per-venue distance
  isn't available yet without a geocoding step — see "later" below).
- Client-side only (this stays a static site, no server to do this work):
  use the browser Geolocation API to get the viewer's position, compute
  straight-line (haversine) distance to each region's center in plain JS,
  and show it on the hub page's region cards (e.g. "~4 mi away"), with an
  option to sort regions nearest-first.
- Graceful fallback for denied/unavailable geolocation: a manual "enter
  your ZIP" input that maps to a rough lat/lon (even a small hardcoded
  table of nearby ZIPs would do for v1) rather than just hiding the
  feature.
- Be upfront in the UI that it's regional distance, not per-venue, until
  the "later" item below lands — don't overclaim precision.
- Privacy note: compute entirely in the browser, never send the viewer's
  location anywhere (there's no backend to send it to) — worth a line in
  the UI so people trust the feature.

Later (bigger lift, not this phase): per-event distance would need actual
venue coordinates, which means geocoding addresses extracted from event
listings during the build (most current sources don't expose a structured
address at all, only a title/detail blob) — likely a free-tier geocoding
API called during `build_digest.py`, cached to stay within rate limits.
Worth doing once regions multiply enough that "which specific event is
closest" actually matters more than "which town is closest."

### Phase 9 — SEO plan + domain name (technical slice ✅ done, PR #10; domain still open)
Requested 2026-08-26.

SEO technical tasks — done (PR #10):
- ✅ Open Graph + Twitter Card *text* meta tags (image still pending, see
  Phase 7's notes — needs a real image asset).
- ✅ `robots.txt` + generated `sitemap.xml` (region pages + hub), produced
  by `build_digest.py` alongside the HTML.
- ✅ JSON-LD structured data (`schema.org/Event`) on every fetched event —
  the single highest-leverage SEO move for a site like this, makes events
  eligible for Google's event rich results. Not yet validated against
  Google's actual Rich Results Test with live data (worth doing once real
  events are flowing through both regions).
- ✅ Canonical `<link>` tags on both page types, driven by one
  `SITE_BASE_URL` constant in `build_digest.py` — currently the GitHub
  Pages URL, update it in one place once a real domain is registered.
- Core Web Vitals: still no JS framework, nothing added that should hurt
  this — not separately measured/verified yet.

Still open (needs a human):

Domain name candidates (research only — I can't register a domain myself,
that's a paid human action; availability below is **unverified**, check a
registrar before committing):
- `zipscout.com`
- `weekendscout.com`
- `nearbyzip.com`
- `townhopper.com`
- `scoutnearby.com`
- `ziptripper.com`
- `ourweekendguide.com`
- `localloopil.com` (ties the brand to Illinois specifically — good for
  local SEO/trust now, but limits the story if this ever expands beyond
  IL; the others are geography-agnostic)

A short, geography-agnostic `.com` is the safer bet for a sponsor-facing
brand that might expand past the Chicago suburbs — lean toward
`zipscout.com` / `weekendscout.com` / `scoutnearby.com` unless a human
picks otherwise. Once a name is chosen and registered: point it at GitHub
Pages via a custom domain (repo Settings → Pages → Custom domain), which
also needs a DNS change only the domain owner can make.

### Phase 10 — Later / parking lot (pick from here once 7-9 are done)
- A third region, to keep validating the architecture holds (e.g. Des
  Plaines, Elk Grove Village, or Schaumburg — all near 60056/60005). Also
  gives Phase 8's distance/sort feature more to actually sort.
- Fix any Phase 5 gaps found once real Arlington Heights data comes in.
- Revisit whether an archive/history feature is worth it (dropped in Phase
  1 for simplicity) — only if a real user asks for it.
- Per-event (not just per-region) distance — see Phase 8's "later" note.

## Working agreements for autonomous iteration

- Cadence is hourly (the platform's durable scheduler has a 1-hour floor;
  a faster session-local scheduler was tried and doesn't survive this
  environment's container lifecycle, confirmed empty after the fact — see
  chat history 2026-08-26). Not every firing needs to end in a merged PR —
  batch a coherent slice of work, ship it when it's coherent and tested,
  skip the ship step (with a one-line note) when mid-slice.
- Always run `python -m pytest tests/ -q` and `python scripts/build_digest.py`
  before committing.
- Never hand-commit `docs/` output — run `git restore docs/` and remove any
  newly-created `docs/<region-id>/` directories before staging.
- Don't add speculative complexity ahead of an actual phase — this is a
  real small business, not a demo.
- No human approval needed to merge your own PRs in this repo — squash
  merge once tests pass locally.
